# K3s Deployment

For local testing a Lightweight Kubernetes cluster is used. [K3s](https://k3s.io/) is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution that is easy to install and manage. It is designed for resource-constrained environments and is ideal for local development and testing.

## Install K3s

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh - 
# Check for Ready node, takes ~30 seconds 
sudo k3s kubectl get node 
```

## Helm

Helm >=3.6 CLI is required to install MLRun. If you don't have it installed, you can do so with the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh
```

```bash
sudo kubectl get nodes
```
